  content: 'I ve been playing for almost 50 years and currently own a number of LPs, Strats, etc. I just purchased the 2015 Memphis Block Neck ES335. Having owned 3 different ES 335s over the last dozen years (and having sold each of the prior 3 because they would not stay in tune), Ive finally found an ES that I will use and keep forever. I am an actively gigging musician, playing classic rock and blues. If you ve tried earlier recent models, please note the redesigned neck profile...it is much more slender than before and this totally changes the playability. Tone is awesome and it sound great clean through my Fender Deluxe Reverb as well as with distorion pedals. Fit and finish are perfect and it even came with decent strings that I played for quite awhile before replacing with my personal favorites. If you ve been contemplating buying an ES, the 2015 Memphis may just be the model year to get. Go try one!',
