"Pick It" is a project that was a part of my Launch Academy Online programming
bootcamp. The challenge was to build a full-fledged web application from scratch,
a review site of any entity I choose. I decided to build a review site for guitars.
I was expected to write user stories and formulate acceptance criteria,
write tests to reflect those criteria, and then write code to build out that
functionality and get the tests to pass.

** It was built using: **
* ruby 2.2.5p319
* Rails 5.0.0.1
* PostgreSQL
* Rspec

** Testing: **
* Rspec 3.5.4
* type *rspec spec* in the terminal to get the test suite running

** Database **
* PostgreSQL
* create a database: *rake db:create*
* migrate: *rake db:migrate*
* seed the data: rake db:seed

** Starting a server **
*  in the terminal type: *rails s*



* Deployment instructions
